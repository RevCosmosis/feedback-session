# feedback-session
WHAT THIS MOD DOES RIGHT NOW:

Allows admins to toggle a "feedback session" mode, which gives everyone noclip, godmode, and will also do the same for anyone who joins the game during the session.

WHAT THIS MOD WILL HEOPFULLY DO:

Allow admins to toggle a "feedback session" mode as mentioned before, but with additional options, like how the session starts, how it ends, and how the map functions during a session. A planned list of functions:

---

	!fs on next

Feedback session will begin on the next round.

	!fs on soft

Feedback session begins right now without resetting anything.
	
	!fs on hard

Feedback session will begin right now by resetting the round.

	!fs off soft

Feedback session ends right now without resetting anything.
	
	!fs off hard

Feedback session ends right now by resetting the round.

----	

	!fs timer on/off

The game timer will/will not continue during the feedback session.
	
	!fs win on/off

Teams can/cannot win during the feedback session.

	!fs end on/off

Feedback session will/will not begin when the map timer is over.

If I'm lazy, the plugin will be much simpler, and simply be an on/off that handles godding/noclipping people who spawn after the thing starts. I'm probably going to be lazy.
